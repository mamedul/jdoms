# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that are welcoming, inclusive, and professional.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

*   Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
    
*   Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
    
*   Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
    
*   Focusing on what is best for the overall community
    
*   Showing appreciation for the efforts of others
    

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

*   The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
    
*   Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks

*   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project lead at mamedul.pub@gmail.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
